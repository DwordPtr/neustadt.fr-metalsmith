Just over a week ago, Microsoft launched Windows 8 to much fanfare. That same day, those of us enrolled in ‘Global and Digital Media’ (taught by Thierry Jadot, President of Aegis France and Thomas Jamet, President of Moxie) at Sciences Po’s School of Communication had the unique opportunity to visit Microsoft headquarters here in Paris and get an inside look at the company and its new operating system.

Windows 8 is a big deal for Microsoft—a much bigger deal than Windows Vista and 7 ever were—for three reasons: they are (a) introducing a completely new user interface that challenges conventions solidified over the last 20 years; (b) betting on the convergence of the tablet and the PC; and, for the first time in its history, (c) producing their own computing hardware, starting with their new tablet *Surface*.

My guess is that it will not be until the next major version of Windows that they are able to completely and confidently embrace this new direction. Until then, Windows 8 is likely to be a transitional OS that, by taking users to alien and often uncomfortable territories, serves to (perhaps too) gently push users towards Microsoft’s vision of the future of personal computing.
