Based on a 1909 science-fiction [short story by E. M. Forster](#). I originally wrote this song when I was about 15 for a school assignment. It's since seen [many versions](#) and has [even been covered](#). This is a softer version I recorded in 2012 in Northampton, MA.

A cover of a song from [Bruce Dickinson](#)'s solo album *Tyranny of Souls*. I really like the lyrics, which reference Einstein. The guitar solo is original. Recorded in 2015 in Paris.

In Italian, *sapere vita, morte e miracoli di qualcuno* is to know everything there is to know about someone. I use this as my morning alarm on my iPhone. Recorded in 2012 in Paris.

*Dreams to Illusions* was once described as "power-game music." It started with my wanting to make background music for a video game so that's not too bad a description. Recorded in 2008 in Kathmandu.

## Threads of Time

 Darker and a lot tamer than what I'm used to writing. The actual reason *Threads of Time* isn't very heavy is because my amp simulator wasn't producing very good sounds at all at that particular time. Recorded in 2007 in Kathmandu.

This one I recorded with my friend [Sushant Rai](#) after having watched this really cheesy 80s movie called Iron Eagle about a kid who flies a fighter jet (unauthorized, of course) to save his father who is a prisoner of war in Afghanistan.

Another fun collaboration with [Sushant Rai](#), with whom I share guitar and vocal duties. This one's a super simple 4-chord song that tells the unfortunate story of a village of valiant (but misguided) warriors under enemy siege.

A Beatles cover in collaboration with my brother [Parag Satyal](#). He plays the guitar and I take care of vocals and the keyboard solo.
