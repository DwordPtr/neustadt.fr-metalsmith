## Why Neustadt.fr?

Neustadt, which means *new city* in German, is a common name for towns in German-speaking regions. According to Wikipedia, there are over 20 in Germany alone. It is also the name of [a very nice caf√©](http://www.cafeneustadt.cz/) in Prague that has a piano that anyone to play. I liked how the word looked and sounded, and *forked* it.

The *.fr* part is because I live in France. And because the other TLDs were not available ;)

## Open Source

Neustadt.fr is built using [Metalsmith](http://metalsmith.io), a node.js-based pluggable site generator.

This website is open-source (MIT license); you can access the source to [my Metalsmith setup on GitHub](https://github.com/parimalsatyal/neustadt.fr-metalsmith). The [front-end static output](https://github.com/parimalsatyal/parimalsatyal.github.io) is hosted on GitHub Pages, which is also a public repository.

You are free to reuse the code in any way you please.
