I studied interactive media and foreign languages (French, Chinese and Italian) at Hampshire College in the US and went on to do a Master's in Communication at Sciences Po Paris. I'm currently working as a user experience designer at Razorfish France.

When not designing or appreciating good beer, I like to make music.

## Neustadt.fr?

Neustadt, or *newcity* in German, is a common name for towns in Germanic regions. [According to Wikipedia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neustadt), there are over 20 in Germany alone. It is also the name of [a very nice Kreuzberg-esque café](http://www.cafeneustadt.cz/) in the New Town Hall in Prague that has a piano that anyone can go and play. I really liked the name.

The *.fr* part is because I live in France. And because *.com* was not available ;)
