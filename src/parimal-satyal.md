Neustadt.fr is where I share my thoughts on technology, culture, music, design and language.

I studied interactive media and foreign languages (French, Chinese and Italian) at [Hampshire College](http://hampshire.edu) in the US and went on to do a Master's in Communication at [Sciences Po Paris](http://sciencespo.fr). I work currently work as user experience consultant in Paris.

When I'm not appreciating [good beer](http://www.schneider-weisse.de/index.php?lang=en&tpl=brauerei.spezialitaeten.eisbock), I'm probably playing my guitar, cooking something, reading about [how our universe might be a hologram](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DIl3Hfh9tY), [learning German](/essays/teaching-myself-german/) or just watching episodes of a [BBC comedy panel show](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007r3n8).

## Neustadt.fr?

Neustadt, or *newcity* in German, is a common name for towns in Germanic regions. [According to Wikipedia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neustadt), there are over 20 in Germany alone. It is also the name of [a very nice Kreuzberg-esque caf√©](http://www.cafeneustadt.cz/) in the New Town Hall in Prague that has a piano that anyone can go and play. 

## Free and Open Source

I built Neustadt.fr using [Metalsmith](https://github.com/metalsmith/metalsmith), an open-source node.js-based static site generator. If you're interested, you can read my [beginner's guide to creating a static blog with Metalsmith ](/essays/crafting-a-simple-blog-with-metalsmith/).

This website is also open-source and shared with an [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). You can access the Metalsmith back-end (and all the source files) on [this public GitHub repository](https://github.com/parimalsatyal/neustadt.fr-metalsmith). You are free to reuse the code in any way you please.

Neustadt.fr is served over [Nginx](https://nginx.org) on an [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com) linux machine running on a [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) droplet in Frankfurt.

## Accessible and Privacy-friendly

Neustadt.fr can be accessed from pretty much any device connected to the internet and able to read HTML: laptops, tablets, smartphones but also old text-based browsers like [lynx](http://lynx.isc.org/), screen readers and e-book readers. I favour native HTML elements to external resources and have deliberately kept all pages light and as free of dependencies as possible. 

This website does not store cookies, does not track you, does not pass on your referrer information forward, does not hijack your scrollbar for 'immersive experiences' and does not abuse your network bandwith. No share buttons, no Google Analytics, and no direct YouTube video embeds. Why? Because I believe it's important to fight [against an increasingly user-hostile web](/essays/against-a-user-hostile-web/).
