Neustadt.fr is where I share my thoughts and ideas on technology, urban living, music, design and language.

I studied interactive media and foreign languages (French, Chinese and Italian) at [Hampshire College](http://hampshire.edu) in the US and went on to do a Master's in Communication at [Sciences Po Paris](http://sciencespo.fr). I'm currently working as a user experience (UX) designer and consultant at [Razorfish France](http://www.razorfish.com/ideas/welcome-nurun.htm).

When I'm not appreciating [good beer](http://www.schneider-weisse.de/index.php?lang=en&tpl=brauerei.spezialitaeten.eisbock), I'm probably playing my guitar, cooking Asian food, reading about [how our universe might be a hologram](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DIl3Hfh9tY) or just watching episodes of a [BBC comedy panel show](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007r3n8).

## Neustadt.fr?

Neustadt, or *newcity* in German, is a common name for towns in Germanic regions. [According to Wikipedia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neustadt), there are over 20 in Germany alone. It is also the name of [a very nice Kreuzberg-esque caf√©](http://www.cafeneustadt.cz/) in the New Town Hall in Prague that has a piano that anyone can go and play. I liked the name a lot, enough for me to name my blog after it.

The *.fr* part is because I live in France. And because *.com* was not available ;)
