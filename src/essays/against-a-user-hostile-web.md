I quit Facebook two months ago.

Despite its undeniable value, I think Facebook is at odds with the open web that I love and defend. This essay is my attempt to explain not only why I quit Facebook but why I believe we're slowly replacing a web that empowers with one that restricts and commoditizes people. And why we should, at the very least, stop and think about it.

## The Web: Backstory 

*(If you want, you can skip the backstory and [jump directly to the table of contents](#table-of-contents)).*

I love the web. 

I don't mean that in the way that someone might say that they love pizza. For many of us in the early 2000s, the web was magical. You connected a phone line to your computer, let it make [a funny noise](#) and suddenly you had access to a seemingly-unending repository of thoughts and ideas from people around the world. 

It might not seem like much now, but what that noise represented was the stuff of science fiction at the time: near-instantaneous communication at a planetary scale. It was a big deal.

I was an average student at school. Despite well-meaning and often wonderful teachers, I didn't thrive much in a school system that valued test performance and fact-retention over genuine curiosity. Had it not been for the web, I might have convinced myself that I was a poor learner; instead, I realized that learning is one of my great passions in life. 

I was 11 when I set up my first website. Growing up in Nepal, this *was* magical. Almost everything I love today — design, cosmoslogy, metal music, computation, foreign languages, philosophy — I discovered through the many pages that found their way to my web browser. All I needed were curiosity, a phone line and that strange little electrical song. And good old [Netscape Navigator](#).

The web enabled that. It's one of humanity's greatest inventions. And now, we the architects of the modern web — web designers, UX designers, developers, creative directors, social media managers, data scientists, product managers, start-up people, strategists — are destroying it. 

We're very good at talking about *immersive experiences*, *personalized content*, *growth hacking*, *responsive strategy*, *user centered design*, *social media activation*, *retargeting*, *CMS* and *user experience*. But behind all this jargon lies the uncomfrotable possibility that we're accomplicies in the destruction of a platform that was meant to empower and bring people together; the possibility that we are instead building a machine that surveilles, subverts, manipulates, overwhelms and exploits people. Excuse me if this sounds a tad dramatic, but I think the situation warrants it.

It all comes down a simple but very dangerous shift: the major websites of today's web are not built for the visitor, but as means of *using* her. Our visitor has become a data point, a customer profile, a potential lead -- a proverbial fly in the spider's web. In the guise of *user centered design*, we're building an increasingly *user-hostile* web.

If you work in the design/communication industry, consider this essay introspective soul-searching by one of your own. If you're a regular web user, consider this an appeal to demand a better web, one that respects you instead of abusing and exploiting you.

## The Web was Born Open

It all began in the early 90s. 

The internet — the physical network that allowed computers around the world to communicate - was already in place but it remained inaccessible to most people. You had to know how to use a local client to connect to a remote FTP, usenet or an email server. This was before the days of ubiquitous graphical user interfaces so you had to type funny commands into a terminal, one of those black screens with green text that that hackers supposedly use to do *Bad Things*. 

Meanwhile, Sir Tim Berners-Lee was working as a consultant (??) at the Centre National de la Recherche Nucléaire (CERN) in Geneva, the same research center that produced the [biggest scientific breakthrough of 2016](LINK: higgsBoson). Frustrated with how difficult it was to find, organize and update technical documentation, he proposed a solution that involved "global computer networked information system" that "presented users with a "web of interlinked documents", called *Mesh*. Pretty soon it became apparent that W3 — world wide web, as it came to be known — could do more than just link technical documents.

On April 30 1993, CERN made a bold decision. It decided to release W3 into the public domain. It renounced all intellectual property and essentially invited anyone at all, anywhere in the world, to play with it. Later, the director of CERN who approved the decision said that he was inspired Richard Stallman's vision of free, open software.

Had CERN decided otherwise and patented the technology to then license it for money, the web would arguably not have taken off the way it did. It might have died out like the [Minitel](LINK: minitel) did in France. The web as we know it was borne of a vision to create an open system that brought people and ideas together, with documents that "may reside on any computer supported by that web". 

Advances in the hyper-text transfer protocol (HTTP), undersea cable infratructure, web browser technology, accessible hosting and web development tools led to a massive democratization and adoption of the web. 

Soon, anyone could put a document on the web and any document could link to any other. It created a completely open platform where a writer in Nepal could freely share her ideas with a dancer in Denmark. A climate science student in Nairobi could access data from the Murdoch weather station in Antarctica. You could start reading about logical fallacies and end up on a website about optical illusions. Read about the history of time-keeping and end up learning about Einstein's special theory of relativity. All interests were catered to. Information could truly be free: transverse borders, cultures and politics. 

That, at least, was the vision. 

My own journey from designing that first website as an 11-year old "webmaster" in Nepal to writing this article as a UX Consultant in France has its origin in that 1993 decision by CERN.

## The Modern Web (of Deception)

The modern web is different. 

It's naturally different from a technological standpoint — we have faster connections, better browser standards, tighter security and far greater capability. But it is also different in the values it espouses. Today, we are so far from that initial vision of linking documents to share knowledge that it's hard to simply browse the web for information without constantly being asked to buy something, like something, follow someone, share the page on Facebook or sign up to some newsletter. All the while being tracked and profiled. 

In the guise of being user-centered, the modern web has become user-hostile. 

Almost every website you go to today reports your activities to third parties that you most likely neither know nor trust. They record where you come from, what pages you visit, how long you stay on each, where you click and where you go next. In fact, since so many websites report to the same third parties, these companies can essentially have your web history on file as you go from link-to-link, website to website. Like an omnipotent eye embedded on Sir Berners-Lee's global system of interlinked documents, noting down everything you do and reporting to private entities who then sell this information for profit.

These companies build profiles, anonymous at first, with your interests and navigational behavior. These profiles then get increasingly personal: they include your email addresses, home adress, income, educational history, political affiliation, information on your family. Over time, they can cross-reference all this information with your location data to figure out where you work, which restaurants you go to, where you gym is. Recently, we even learnt that Google was able to associate your offline purchases with your online ad viewing history (albeit *anonymously*, it would appear). Once they have that, they can look into your behavior and psychology: what kind of ads do you tend to click on? What kind of messages resonate most with you? What are the best strategies to influence your opinion?

The Leave campaign responsible for Brexit in the United Kingdom and Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign both bought the services of a certain [Cambridge Analytica](#), a company that boasts a gigantic database containing personal details of million of people (of up to "")(??). The goal? Craft hyper-personalized messages to change voting behavior based on your individual personalities, and by extension, your attitudes, opinions and fears. If you are identified as a dad of three young kids in rural Texas,  message might suggest that only a certain candidate will be able to protect your family against real or imagined threats. If you are identified as a patriot who's previously posted comments about about gun rights and the second amendment, it might be about about crime rates and how the opposition is trying to take your constitutional rights away from you. (These examples, although dramatic, actually come directly from the company). 

>>You become a manipulable data point at the mercy of big corporations who sell their ability to manipulate you based on the data you volunteer.

This is the equivalent of someone following you in real life as you go about your everyday business, like a private eye who notes down with whom you meet, what you talk about with whom, what you spend time looking at in stores. A private eye who takes notes and then sells it to the highest bidder. But you got to enter the the store for free, so you should be so glad. The stores might also justify it. *"Sure it's a bit creepy, but we'll be able to give you better recommendations if we know what you like"*. 

But how do they get your personal information -- where you live, who your friends are, where you were, what you bought? Most of it you volunteer  yourself on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. The little share buttons you see on websites aren't just there to make it easy for you to post a link to Facebook; they also allow Facebook to be present and gather information about you from pretty much any website. 

But how can you know that any of this is true? 

## Track the Trackers: An Experiment

Perhaps you think I'm being a tad too dramatic. 

In your defense, all of this does sound like some dystopian fantasy. But I'm not that great a fiction writer quite yet. Let me give illustrate my point with a little experiment. We'll pick a major website that you might visit regularly and identify third parties it shares your information with.

We'll need a few things:

- a test website (we'll take Le Monde, France's biggest national daily)
- Dataskydd.net, a Swedish associaion for data protection and privacy (of which I'm a proud member) and
- Pingdom Website Speed Test

Let's take a random article from a few days ago: [La population de loups augmente en France](http://www.lemonde.fr/biodiversite/article/2017/05/23/la-population-de-loups-augmente-en-france_5132687_1652692.html) (*The wolf population grows in France*). 

If you run this URL through Dataskydd's Webbkoll and Pingdom's Website Speed Test, you learn a few interesting things: the page is **3.7 MB** in size, makes **653 requests** and takes **4.83 seconds** to load when access from Stockholm, Sweden. 

It also stores **78 cookies**, of which **60 are third-party** (these are little pieces of text stored on your computer by websites other than lemonde.fr; cookies are normally used to save session information but are also used to identify and track you), and connects to **82 third parties**. And if all this weren't enough, your connection to LeMonde and the majority of third-party connections are over **unsecure HTTP** (instead of the more secure HTTPS, which should be a requirement). 

That's a lot of big numbers for an article of less than 700 words plus one image. 

Now let's look at some of the third parties that the website connects to when you load it: 

- [Weborama](weborama.fr): advertising platform for analytics, digital marketing and behavioral targeting
- [Visual Revenue](visualrevenue.com): predictive analytics platform
- [AppNexus](adnxs.com): multimedia content monitization service
- [Outbrain](outbrain.com): "online advertiser specializing in presenting sponsored website links" (Wikiepdia)
- [Facebook](facebook.com): a social network and micro-targeted advertising platform
- [Cedexis](https://www.cedexis.com/): a CND/ad-delivery platform

These are mostly advertising or content monetization platforms; companies like Weborama make money by selling information about you. When people say, "you're the product", it isn't just some analogy, it accurately reflecs the business propositions of such companies. 

If you take just the main article—the words and the images—and put it in an HTML file, it would weigh considerably less than 3.7MB and would make a lot fewer requests. In fact, I made [my own version of the article](#LINK) without all the extras.

Some numbers: It weighs XX KB, and makes 1 external request. Does not require Javascript and can even be read on a toaster (okat maybe not, but surely on a Kindle). 

>> This means that 90% of the data being transferred between you and Le Monde has nothing to do with the article itself. Le Monde might principally be a newspaper in its printed version, but the online version is an invasive, insecure advertising platform with good content (in that order).

If you're curious, trying using Dataskydd and Webbkoll on other websites you visit to see how privacy-friendly and respectful these websites are. You could alernatively also download uBlock origin for your browser and use it to see which third-party requests it blocked (you'll see some familiar names). 

All this might not be illegal (although there's some doubt, especially now that in the context of up the upcoming European-wide General Regulation on Data Protection), but it is rather disrepectful towards the user. Not only are these websites breaking my trust—when I visit your website, I entered into contact with you, not 80 other websites—but they are loading content from websites neither know nor trust. And which may contain malware. Using an ad/content-blocker isn't cheating the system; it's taking very basic precautions that websites like Le Monde can't be bothered to take to protect you. For me, it's a basic necessity in the modern web. 

My trouble isn't with ads per se. If websites hosted their own ads and displayed them responsibly, I wouldn't care. I might even appreciate them. Back in the early 2000s, UltimateMetal.com had self-sold ad space that bands could buy to promote their new albums. I actually discovered a few good bands through them. But when those ads are used to track me, send my information to and load code from third parties, often through insecure channels, I find that a content blocker is a basic necessity. Even the New York Times couldn't protect its XX monthly user from malware spread through their pages thanks to an ad network.

If you're reading this and are wondering what to do to protect yourself, skip ahead to the [The Way Forward](#ANCHOR) section. 

If you run a website and you put official share buttons on your website, use intrusive analytics platforms (like X and Y, instead of Piwik), serve ads through a third-party ad network or use pervasive cookies to share and sell data on your users, you're contributing to a user-hostile web. You're using free and open-source tools created by thousands of collaborators around the world, over an open web and in the spirit of sharing, to subvert users. 

## Gated Communities (or the simple beauty of httpd)

One of the most impressive things about the internet (and consequently also the web) is that it is decentralized. No central authority gets to decide which page is more important than others and you don't have to play by anyone else's terms to publish and read what you want. There's isn't anything like a *main server* that stores the code that runs the Internet; it's just a protocol on a physical backbone (of undersea cables). 

You could buy a Raspberry Pi Zero today for 5€, connect it to the internet, set up a chat server on it, give it a public address and the world would be able to connect to it and talk to one other. Sure, it might not perform too well and no one might actually use it, but it is technically possible.

But most of the time we spend on the web today is no longer on the open internet; it's on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. While Facebook provides a valuable service, it is also a for-profit, private  company. Their source of revenue is advertising. It is the epitome of centralized. 

Try posting a picture of the (nude painting) or your naked breasts; it'll almost certainly be removed. It's against their terms of use. To use their platform, you have to agree to whatever conditions they set, however absurd. If you replace the open web with Facebook, you're giving up your right to publish and share on your terms. The data that you post there does not belong to you; you're putting it in a closed system. If one day Facebook decides to shut down — unlikely as that might seem today — your data goes with it. Sure, you might be able to download parts of it, but then what?

This works because they know you'll agree to it. You'll say you don't have a choice, because your friends are all there — the infamous "network effect". This is Facebook's currency, its source of strength but also a crucial dependency. And this is what we often fail to realize: without us, Facebook would be nothing. But without Facebook, we'd only be inconvenienced. 

Facebook needs you more than you need it.  And they do their best to keep you on their website as long as possible. Your attention is worth a lot to a lot of companies who are convinced that traditional advertising is dead and that micro-targeted campaigns work better. (And they mostly do, from their point of view). So it's only natural that platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn come up with absurd techniques to create addiction: wish your friend happy birthday, wish your colleague a happy work anniversary (who does that?!), here's a video we made about you, three friends are going to an event near you, continue watching the video you started even as you scroll, be the first to comment, react to this photo, tell everyone what you're to. The longer you stay, the more information you give, the more valuable your profile — and the platform — is to advertisers. 

I'm not saying that what Facebook is doing is entirely unethical or illegal; it is not. It has to make money to make up for the resources it employs to keep the website running and it does so by advertising. Every time you choose to use a free service like Instagram, LinkedIn, Gmail or Snapchat, you are paying for the convenience with your eyes, your data and your attention. There's nothing inherently wrong as long you as you understand and consent to this exchange of value. Do you? Does your daughter? Your dad? 

What I'm against is the centralization of services; Facebook and Google are virtually everywhere today. Through share buttons, login gateways and analytics, they are able to be present on virtually every website you visit. This gives them immense power and control. 

You see, the web wasn't meant to be a gated community. It's actually pretty simple.

A web server, a public address and an HTML file are all that you need to share your thoughts (or indeed, art, sound or software) with anyone in the world. No authority from which to seek approval, no editorial board, no publisher. No content policy, no dependence on a third party startup that might fold in three years to begin [a new adverture](#LINK: our wonderful adventure).

That's what the web makes possible. It's friendship over hyperlink, knowledge over the network, romance over HTTP.

In fact, the browser you're reading this on (Chrome, Firefox, Links, whatever), the web server that's hosting this website (Nginx), the operating system that this server runs on (Ubuntu), the programming tools used to make it all work (python, gcc, node.js...) -- all of these things were created collectively by contributors all around the world, brought together by HTTP. And given away for free in the spirit of sharing.

The web is open and democratic by design and it empowers people. This is the web we're breaking. 

## Free but not Free

The modern web began, I think, when it expanded from an information system to a broader platform for information and services. 

Hotmail wanted to give everyone in the planet a free email address. Search engines like Google (and Dogpile, Excite, Altavista and Northern Lights, for those who remember) offered to help us find relevant information in a rapidly growing, unorganized collection of linked documents. There was even a period where Mozilla's DMOZ projet had the ambitious goal of being an open, human-run directory of all things on the internet (much like an online version of the Yellow Pages of yore). Then came Wikipedia, perhaps the most ambitious project in organizing human knowledge since the library of Alexandria.

The next big breakthrough was e-commerce, the ability to buy and sell over the internet. This naturally brought a lot of value to humanity: people could browse and buy stuff from the comfort of their homes and businesses big and small could reach more people. Amazon went from being a relatively small online bookstore to a global marketplace. eBay became a global marketplace for people wanting to buy and sell second-hand goods. Paypal promised to let anyone send and receive money from anyone, anywhere in the world.

Up to this point, the goal was still broadly to serve people. Companies, though, start realizing that maintaining a large website serving thousands of users requires time, energy and resources. It costs money. But users wouldn't use your service if it wasn't free.

Therein lies the problem.

Most of us got used to things being free (as in 0€) on the internet, but the services we were using still cost money. It was a race to the bottom and companies were forced to find ways to become profitable -- the best they could come up was was an ad-supported model, where they would provide some service or content, get you to sign up and then use their user base as currency to negotiate payment from advertisers.

Most user who now expect services at zero cost and are unwilling to pay with money now simply pay for them in other ways: with their data, attention, time, 'good' behavior and, I'm afraid, sovereignity. 

## The Way Forward

If you want to protect yourself (as a user) from predatory web marketing companies and defend the open web, there a few things you can do today at an individual level. If you're a web professional (a designer, UX consultant, strategist, programmer...), there are a number of considerations for better respecting your users and protecting their privacy (and your integrity). Here's a basic list:

### For end users (you, dear reader)
- If you use Chrome as your main browser, consider switching to Chromium, the open-source version of the browser. Consider minimalist browsers like Min (and choose to block all ads, trackers and scripts) to browser news websites. If you like a certain news source, support it by subscribing if you're able!
- Install a content/ad blocker for your browser: I recommend uBlock Origin (available for Firefox, Chrome and Safari on most platforms). 
- Install HTTP Everywhere for your browser; this forces your information through secure, encrypted channels (HTTPS vs HTTP one) if possible. It can also be configured to only allow connections to HTTPS websites.
- Think about how much information/details you provide to social media platforms like Facebook, Linked, Twitter and Instagram. They already have quite a lot (including the ability to recognize you by name on photographs), but what other information are you volunteering? Where you are, whom you're with, information about your friends?
- Consider quitting social networks, especially Facebook (but download your data first!). What would you miss the most? Are there alternatives? 
- Consider alternatives to free services provided by the likes of Google and Facebook. Today, if both of these companies shut down (or implement policies I don't like), I would mostly be fine because my contact with them is limited. I use DuckDuckGo and Startpage for search (free); Fastmail for email and calender (less than 40€ a year) ; HERE WeGo for maps (free); Signal, email and IRC for messaging (free, along with iMessage, Whatsapp and Twitter); Digital Ocean for web hosting (about 5€ per month). 
- Pay for services and content tha you like, if you are able. If you like reading The Guardian, for example, consider subscribing. If your favourite YouTube channel is on Patreon, consider pledging a small amount per video. If you like services like Pinboard.in that charge in return for a useful service, buy it. There's mutual respect when both the user and the service provider know what basic service they are buying/selling.
- At the very least, consider that the platforms you use need you more than you need them. You have power over them (unfortunately, in numbers) and they know it. If enough people care about privacy and respect for their data and time, platforms will have to adapt to stay relevant.

### For web professionals (you, fellow industry colleague)
- Consider not putting share buttons everywhere. They're visual noise and make third party connections every time the page is loaded (adding to load time). If you have to, create your own instead of using ones provided by Facebook and co. (so that a click is needed before a request is made to their servers)
- Support HTTPS. It's super easy (and free!) with Let's Encrypt so you don't have an excuse to not respect your users' privacy
- Think about accessibility also in terms of page size, load times and tech requirements: will your website work without Javascript? What percentage of your the total weight of your page is actual information? How many third party requests are you making? How long would it take to load on a 56.6k dial-up or on EDGE? How does it render for speech readers? Can it be read via a text-based browser? (It's a fun experiment; try visiting your website with a text-based browser like lynx or Links). 
- Refuse client requests to impement hyper-invasive technologies like canvas fingerprinting 
- Consider replacing Google Analytics with a more privacy-respecting analytics software like Piwik. Even better if you can host it yourself!
- Minimize third-party dependencies like Google Fonts (this website uses Brick.im instead).
- Avoid ad networks (like the plague!) if possible. Serve your own ads by selling ad space the old school way if you're able. If not, explore privacy-respecting methods of serving ads, including developments powered by the blockchain (like the Basic Attention Token). 
- Respect Do Not Track!
- Carefully consider the benefits of hyper personalisation and retargeting. The benefits are debatable but the long term consequences might be desasterous. Ask yourself: would you be okay with a company collecting as much data (as you seek to collect) on your teenage daughter, your nephew in college, your husband or your grand-mother?
- Consider business models where you actually respect your clients and your website visitors instead of using them. If you can't be honest about your business model with your client, maybe you need to ask questions.

## Thoughts and feedback
I hope this essay can, at the very least, spark a debate amongst web users and web professionals about privacy, the open web and respect for people using the web. If you have thoughts—you agree, disagree, have reservations, other ideas or a suggestion—I'd love to hear them!
