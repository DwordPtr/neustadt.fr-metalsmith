title: Island (At Long Last)
date: 2015-04-14
blurb: At Long Last began as a haiku but just kept on going. I'm not entirely sure where the dark overtones come from, nor the Siren theme. It's not like I often think about sea-dwelling homicidal nymphs.

Those adrift at sea might sight it,  
See shelter from the storm.  
And moor their ship and wander  
This island long forlorn.

“At long last we’ve made it!”,  
The captain might declare,  
Unb'known to him the dreary  
Night that's to become his lair.

For when night has fallen  
And sleep comes to them all,  
That sweetest wail will beckon  
From that cold, remorseless mare.

See, this island hides a secret  
That few have lived to share.  
The captain’s men shall know it  
As they’re driven to despair.

The sirens, unforgiving  
Escort them to their graves,  
A gentle chant now guides them  
To a realm beyond these waves

Day breaks on the island  
And silence greets the shore,  
But a lone ship to remember  
What befell the night before.

Many moons have passed since  
And that ship no longer stands,  
On the horizon, two lost seamen  
Revel 'pon what they’ve chanced:

“At long last we’ve made it!”  
Shouts the fellow to his mate.  
As they celebrate their fortune  
The sirens lie in wait.
