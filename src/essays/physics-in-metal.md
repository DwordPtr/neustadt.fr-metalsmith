I was listening to Stratovarius' fast-paced "Event Horizon" after a very long time when I realized that the song was in fact *actually* about the event horizon of a black hole. The song is a bit silly—it involves someone approaching a black hole, presumably in a spaceship with an onboard computer that has a vaguely Russian accent—but the lyrics do make several assertions that have a foundation in science.

Stratovarius is just one of many metal bands to tackle concepts in theoretical physics. Let's look at some now and try to understand the science a little bit.

I should say at this point that I have no training in physics and that my explanations are simply those of a very interested layperson. If you're a physicist and you spot inaccuracies, let me know! (Or send a pull request to this article on GitHub).

## Event Horizon - Stratovarius

Let's start with this verse:

> Nothing escapes  
> And the boundary's been breached  
> All matter and shape  
> Destination's reached

The 'boundary' here is the event horizon, that boundary beyond which no matter or radiation can counter the immense gravity of a black hole and is warped back in. In other words, "nothing escapes". This is why a black hole is black - light particles beyond the event horizon aren't visible to the outside observer.

The "destination's reached" bit is interesting. Let's assume that by "destination" we mean the event horizon and not the "singularity" at the heart of a black hole. So if you were observing something falling into a black hole, you'd never actually see it reach the event horizon because of time dilation (time would slow down in relation to you); the destination would never be reached. But if you were the one being sucked in (whoops!), you might both be annihilated *and* survive (as information, not your human form) somewhere in the event horizon, at least according to the holographic principle advanced by Gerard't Hooft and Leonard Susskind. In [this context](information paradox), you might indeed reach your destination. This principle also suggests, by the way, that we might be living in in a hologram, kind of. We'll know a little better by the end of this year.

Back to the song:

> A star dies, collapsing in its core  
> End of the journey, it won't be seen anymore

This is essentially usually how most black holes are created. A massive star runs out of nuclear fuel, is unable to produce enough energy to counter its own gravity and quite literally collapses into its own core. It's the "the end of the journey" for a star and "it won't be seen anymore" because, well, no light gets past the event horizon. (We'll ignore that black holes often form accretion disks that can be quite bright and visible. Think **Gargantua** from Interstellar.)

Finally, we have the the chorus:

> I can see the point of no return  
> And when the light is slowly turning to red

The "point of no return" is often how an event horizon is described and you *would* be able to see it as the boundary where the "black" part of the black hole starts. But why is the light slowly turning to red? Because electromagnetic radiation (like light) being pulled into the black hole is *redshifted*; the wavelength increases and is shifted towards the red end of the spectrum. So visible light would indeed turn reddish.

Kudos, Stratovarius! Lots of good science here. Now how about explaining the oddly Russian-sounding onboard computer?

## Bruce Dickinson - Navigate the Seas of the Sun

Bruce Dickinson is someone I admire almost as much as Richard Feynman or Carl Sagan. His lyrics are often reflective, contemplative and introspective. *Navigate the Seas of the Sun* has a particularly poetic quality and captures that sense of wonder, that desire to know and understand, that is so important to science. And it references Einstein.

Take this verse:

> Purple gold and blue  
> Living colors every hue  
> Flowers in the garden of the gods  
> No one can ever know  
> If you never saw them grow  
> This darkness is really full of light  

If you look at images of distant galaxies and nebulae taken by the Hubble space telescope, you know exactly what Bruce is referring to. Our universe, even just the tiny part we've seen, is an explosion of color. It's beautiful and awe-inspiring, but isn't most of space dark, empty space?

As beautiful as the universe is wavelengths that our eyes are able to see (the visible spectrum), it is arguably as beautiful in infrared, x-ray or ultraviolet light. The darkness is in fact, "really full of light", just not visible light.

Next, we move to Einstein:

> If God is throwing dice,  
> And Einstein doesn't mind the chance  
> We'll Navigate the Seas of the Sun  

I love this bit. It refers to Einstein's stubborn refusal to accept the probabilistic nature of reality described by quantum mechanics. He famously said that "God doesn't play dice with the universe". In fact, he even derided the notion of entanglement in quantum physics as "spooky action at a distance" (*spukhafte Fernwirkung* in German), *spooky* because it's absurd. Except in this case, Einstein was wrong and entanglement has yet to be falsified. In fact, it was experimentally demonstrated just last month by a scientists at Delft Technical University.

Stephen Hawking wrote in an essay:

> Thus it seems that even God is bound by the Uncertainty Principle, and can not know both the position, and the speed, of a particle. So God does play dice with the universe.

Einstein didn't live long enough to witness how far quantum mechanics would come, but if he did, I'd like to think he would have accepted the results. I don't think he would "mind the chance" at all.

## Ayreon - The Theory of Everything

And finally, there's Ayreon. Where do I even start? This entire album is Anthony Arjen-Lucassen's metal opera love-letter to physics and the scientific quest to understand the true nature of reality. Basically we have the "Prodigy", a savant with a gift for numbers and son of a physicist obsessed with finding the theory of everything. The story revolves around his struggle to come to terms with a physical world very different from the mathematical one in his mind. In that process, we get some excellent physics.

In 'Singularity', the Father sings:

> One single master equation  
> Unification of the great and small  
> I hear the notes but the arrangement is wrong  
> And I'm starting to doubt, but I can't give up now I'm so near  

His words underline the current state of physics: our inability to reconcile Einstein's relativity, which describes  "the great" (gravity, orbital mechanics, black holes) and quantum mechanics, which describes the "small" (the world of atoms, quarks, electromagnetic and nuclear forces, Higgs boson). We've been at it since the 30s and, although we're arguably closer, we're far from coming up that elusive "one single master equation".

One promising if controversial approach is superstring theory, a framework that basically reduces everything to tiny vibrating one-dimensional supersymmetric strings. This is what the Father is referring to in the preceding verse:

> I'm so close to the answer  
> A dazzling symphony of cosmic strings  
> I feel the pulse, vibrating just out of reach  
> The music of space

String theory started out quite elegantly and has now grown into something of a mess with five different versions. Given the Father's assertions about hearing the notes (strings vibrate at different frequencies, like on a guitar) but not being able to figure out the right arrangement, I'm guessing he's a frustrated string theorist (is there another kind?) who knows string theory is the correct approach but can't quite figure out how to fit it all together.

The Prodigy later reveals to a psychologist:

> I see things that don’t belong  
> In this four-dimensional world  
> There is so much more beyond  
> More to unveil, more to reveal  

The math describes a reality beyond our four (three spatial, one temporal) dimensions, but we can't quite *see* it yet. In fact, superstring theory admits as many as eleven dimensions! But it all remains theoretical.

The final bit is a fascinating duet between Father and Son that is just just jam-packed with physics. It even includes a handy check-list of things to accomplish to find a theory of everything, should you want to take a stab at it yourself:

> **Isolate the graviton**  
> **Verify the Higgs-Boson** ✓   
> Photons, hadrons  
> Gluons, fermions  
> **Demonstrate the tachyon**  
> **Find the missing baryons**  
> Neutrons, protons  
> Nucleons, electrons  
> Ride a wave of gravity  
> **Unravel super symmetry**  
> Position x, sparticles  
> Momentum p, dark energy  
> Einstein’s relativity  
> Meets Heisenberg’s uncertainty  
> Causality, eternity  
> Singularity, infinity!

Luckily we've already done with step 2. Scientists working at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN last year confirmed the existence of the Higgs boson, a particle previously only mathematically predicted to *need* to exist. Our understanding is still quite rudimentary, but that should all change when the CEPC in China becomes operational in five to ten years.

The graviton is a theorised particle responsible for gravity.
