# Teaching Myself German

This is a guide to teaching yourself German.

Kinda. Actually, it’s not a guide at all. It’s really just an annotated list of links to resources I’m personally using to learn German. You might find it useful if you’re considering a similar endeavour.

Teaching yourself a foreign language is not easy. German is the first one that I’m learning on my own, without taking classes like I did for my other languages. Over time, you learn how to learn languages. I figure if I have the motivation, curiosity and the willingness to make mistakes (and occasionally sound very silly indeed), I should be fine.

My rules are very simple:

1. Practice everyday, even if it’s just 15 or 30 minutes a day
2. Don’t stress out about things I don’t understand yet
3. Speak. Even if I make mistakes, if I can’t find the right word, even if it would all be easier to say in English.

I’d say „have fun!” but that goes for most things in life — it’s a prerequisite for learning. Here’s hoping you find this non-guide useful too.

## Back story

(You can skip the back story and go directly to the links if you’d like).

The German verb for ’to celebrate’ is ‘feiern’. I associate this with the word for ‘fire’ (‘Feuer’). You might think this is because the two sound rather alike but that’s not really it. It has to do with ‘Silvester’, German for New Year’s Eve.

On December 31, 2015 I learnt that the Germans really, really like their fireworks. It was exactly the sort of brazen disregard for safety for which my preconceived notions could not have prepared me. I was celebrating with close friends in Leipzig, 2 hours south of Berlin. Anders, a calm Swede who had experienced the madness in Berlin first-hand the year before had previously warned me:

„You know those things that you normally shoot up in the air? Rockets? Yeah well people were launching them everything, even inside the metro! It was like a war zone!”

Luckily, Leipzig doesn’t have a metro. It was still absolutely insane. I had been somewhat obsessed with Germany for the past year or so but there, on an small street off Könnerlitzstraße, in the backdrop of loud, bright fireworks and sekt-induced mirth, in the company of revellers — friends and strangers — something was absolutely clear: I had to learn German.

I had toyed with the idea of learning Deutsch for a while. I even considered learning it over French many, many years ago; I only picked the latter because my local Alliance Française had a nice café/bistro and the Goethe Institut didn’t. That was reason enough for me to pick French over German.

My closest friend in Paris was German (he still is; he’s just not in Paris anymore) and he introduced me to German, mostly Bavarian, beer. I loved how the words looked and sounded: *Hefeweiße*, *Dunkles Doppelbock*, *Märzen Rauchbier*. Then when he and Charlotte (who you’ll recall from my last essay) moved to Germany, I had two very good reasons to visit Deutschland. Since, I’ve been several times to five different cities and, on the way, discovered even more types of beer.

The turning point though was really Silvester in Leipzig. Everything else just fell into place after that.

I’m into my third month now and I am quite happy with my progress. I was in Leipzig again just last weekend and was able to hold a conversation almost entirely in German for over 20 minutes. Sure, I occasionally struggled to find the right words and used very simple structures, but to me that’s very encouraging.

I owe this progress to these resources. And the fact that I seem to have somehow surrounded myself with really nice people who speak German and don’t mind helping me out, but more about that later.

First, the links:


## Laying the Foundation: German Grammar
I remember Charlotte learning German two years ago when she was still in Paris; now, she speaks it fluently. I asked her if she had any advice.

	„You need to really study the grammar,” she said. „Otherwise things won’t make a lot of sense.”

She was of course right. Up until that point, I had been picking  up words and phrases by ear but the structure of the language remained elusive. The answer was a good, simple and comprehensive Grammar book.

I found this in **Basic German: A Grammar and Workbook** by *H. Schenke and K. Seago* ([available for free on archive.org]). Especially if you’ve already some experience learning languages, you’ll find its direct approach very effective. My understanding of both written and spoken German improved dramatically after going through all the chapters and exercises.

My advice is to go through it even though you don’t necessarily understand everything. Your mind will better internalise German grammar and make logical connections between words in sentences you might come across elsewhere.

I’m re-reading this book now and find that the things I struggled with the first time now are quite logical.

## Learn German from the Streets
Learning basic grammar is essential but it won’t help you get a feel feel for language or understand the people who speak them.

I learn best when I hear things in context: a conversation amongst friends or colleagues or even a passing remark overheared on the street. They might be „raw” and unfiltered and not necessarily accessible to the beginner but they give an insight into the language: the flow, the rhythm, the attitude.

Easy German offers you exactly that. It’s a series of short video interviews with people on the street, around a number of different subjects. My favourites so far are: „What do the Swiss think of the Germans?”, „Weekend market in Münster” and „In der Kneipe”. They’re great for at least five reasons:

1. You get to hear German as it’s really spoken, in its many many varieties and dialects. (Including Swiss and Austrian ones). 
2. Most videos are subtitled in both English and German, so you can follow along even more complex topics and pick up words and expressions as you go.

3. The hosts are absolutely fantastic; you want to chat with them over a pint of Weißbier (as I hope to someday do). 
4. The topics are interesting and quite contemporary: the refugee crisis, organic food, Christmas celebrations, flirting, bar/pub culture. 
5. It’s free (vielen dank if you guys ever read this!), but you can support them on Patreon.

Easy German videos complement the grammar book quite nicely. I find myself coming back to my favourite videos now and then and understanding a little more each time. It’s very satisfying.
