(I quit Facebook two weeks ago.

Despite its undeniable value, I think Facebook is at odds with the open web that I love and defend. This essay is my attempt to properly explain not only why I quit Facebook, but why I believe we're slowly replacing a web that empowers with one that restricts and commoditizes people. And why we should stop and think about it.)

I love the web. 

I don't mean that in the way that someone might say that they love pizza. For many of us in the early 2000s, the web was magical. You connected a phone line to your computer, let it make a funny noise and suddenly you had access to a near-infinite repository of thoughts and ideas from people around the world.  

It might not seem like much now, but what that noise represented was the stuff of science fiction not too long ago. Near-instantaneous communication at a planetary scale. It was a big deal - for the planet, but also for me.

I wasn't a particularly good student at school. Despite well-meaning and often rather wonderful teachers, I didn't thrive much in a school system that valued test performance and fact-retention over genuine curiosity. Had it not been for the internet, I might have convinced myself that I was a poor learner; instead, I realized that learning is one of my great passions in life. 

I can't overestimate how much the the web shaped me. I was 11 when I set up my first website and felt even back that the entire planet could be my backyard. Growing up in Nepal, this *was* magical. Almost everything I love today — design, metal music, computation, foreign languages, cosmology, philosophy, foreign languages — has roots in the many pages that found their way to my web browser. All I needed curiosity, a phone line and that strange little electrical song. 

The web enabled that. One of humanity's greatest inventions. And now, we the architects of the modern web — web designers, UX designers, developers, creative directors, social media managers, data scientists, product managers, start-up people, strategists — are breaking it.

We're very good at talking about *immersive experiences*, *personalized content*, *growth hacking*, *responsive strategy*, *user centered design*, *social media activation*, *retargeting*, *CMS* and *user experience*. But behind all this jargon lies the uncomfortable possibility that we're (unwitting?) accomplicies in the destruction of a platform that was meant to empower and bring people together. The possibility that we are instead building a machine that surveilles, subverts, manipulates and exploits people.

It comes down a simple but very dangerous shift: the major websites of today's web are not built for the visitor, but as means of *using* her. Our visitor has become a data point, a customer profile, a potential lead -- a proverbial fly in the spider's web. In the guise of *user centered design*, we're building an increasingly user-hostile web.

If you work in the design/communication industry, consider this essay introspective soul-searching by one of your own. If you're a regular web user, consider this an appeal to demand a better web, one that respects you instead of abusing you. 

This is quite a long essay, so feel free to skip to individual parts. Each section should be self-contained:

- The Web was Born Open: a very brief history of the web
- The Modern Web (of Deception): the disturbing state of the web today
- Track the Trackers, a Personal Experiment: whom websites are sharing your information with
- Gated Communities: recentralization and closed platforms
- The Way Forward: open tools, technologies and services for a better web 

## The Web was Born Open

It all began in the early 90s. 

The internet — the physical network that allowed computers around the world to communicate - was already in place but it remained inaccessible to most people. You had to know how to use a local client to connect to a remote FTP, usenet or an email server. This was before the days of ubiquitous graphical user interfaces, so you had to type funny commands into a terminal, the sort the thing that movies suggest that hackers supposedly use to do bad things. The server would respond with cryptic responses that you were supposed to know what to do with. 

Meanwhile, Sir Tim Berners-Lee was working at the Centre National de la Recherche Nucléaire (CERN) in Geneva, the same research center that gave the biggest scientific breakthrough of 2016 -- confirmation of the higgs boson. Frustrated with how difficult it was to find, organize and update technical documentation, he proposed a solution that involved "global computer networked information system" that "presented users with a "web of interlinked documents", called *Mesh*. Pretty soon it became apparent that W3 — world wide web, as it came to be known — could do more than just link technical documents at Europe's biggest nuclear research center.

On April 30 1993, CERN made a bold decision. It decided to release W3 into the public domain. It renounced all intellectual property and essentially invited anyone at all, anywhere in the world, to play with it. Later, the director of CERN who approved the decision said that he was inspired Richard Stallman's vision of free, open software.

Had CERN decided otherwise and patented the technology to then license it for money, the web would arguably not have taken off the way it did. The web as we know it was borne of a vision to create an open system that brought people and ideas together, with documents that "may reside on any computer supported by that web". 

Advances in the HTTP protocol, better undersea cable infratructure, improvements in web browser technology, more accessible hosting solutions and the flourishing of web development tools (many also fre and open source), helped create a platform where anyone, anywhere on the planet could have a voice and reach anyone else. 

The web empowered. Anyone could put a document and any document could link to any other. It created a completely open platform where a writer in Nepal could freely share her ideas with a painter in Norway. A climate science student in Nairobi could access data from the Murdoch weather station in Antarctica. 

You could start reading about logical fallacies and end up on a website about optical illusions. Read about the history of time-keeping and end up learning about Einstein's special theory of relativity. All interests were catered to. Information could truly be free: transverse borders, cultures and politics. That, at least, was the vision. 

My own journey from designing that first website as an 11-year old "webmaster" in Nepal to writing this article as a User Experience Designer in France has its origin in that 1993 decision by CERN.

## The Modern Web (of Deception)

The modern web is different. 

Naturally from a technological standpoint — we have faster connections, better browser standards, tighter security — but also in terms of the values it vehicles. We're so far from the initial goal of linking documents to share information that we now need a plethora of tools to simply browse the web freely, without being constantly tracked and profiled. In the guise of being user-centered, the modern web has become user-hostile. 

Almost every website you go to today reports your activities to third parties that you do not know. They record where you came from, what pages you visit, how long you stay on each, where you clicked and where you went next. In fact, since so many websites report to the same third parties, they can essentially record your entire web history on file as you go from link-to-link, website to website. Like an omnipotent eye embedded on Sir Berners-Lee's global system of interlinked documents, noting down everything you do and reporting to private companies who then sell this information.

These companies build profiles, anonymous at first, with your interests and navigational behavior. These profiles then get increasingly personal: they include your email addresses, home adress, income, educational history, political affiliation, perhaps even details on your family members. Over time, they can cross-reference allt his information with your location data to figure out which restaurants you go to, where you work, where you gym is. Once you have that, they look into your behavior and psychology: what kind of ads do you tend to click on? What kind of messages resonate with you? What are the best strategies to influence your opinion?

Companies like XX and YY exist to provide their clients a way to individually identify you the minute you land on their pages; no need for you to sign up or provide any information directly. 

Did they ask you if you were okay with it? Not explicitly. In their mind, by simply using their website, you consent to all of this. 

- "Didn't you know? It's all explained in a link we place in that annoying cookie warning and in on our privacy policy and terms of use pages."

But how do they get your personal information? Mostly because you volunteer most of it yourself on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. The little share buttons you see on websites aren't just there to make it easy for you to post a link to Facebook; they also allow Facebook to be present and gather information about you from pretty much any website. 

We are replacing a web that empowered and enabled a free exchange of ideas with one that tracks, subverts, restricts and commoditizes people. But how can you know that any of this is true? 

## Track the Trackers: An Experiment

Perhaps you think I'm being dramatic. Fair enough. In your defense, all of this does sound like some dystopian fantasy. But I'm not that great a fiction writer (yet, hopefully). Let me give illustrate my point with a little experiment. We'll pick a major website that you might visit regularly and identify third parties it shares your information with.

We'll need a few things:

- a test website (we'll take Le Monde, France's biggest national daily)
- Dataskydd.se and
- Pingtastic

(Test data)

We could do this test with a number of other common websites:

CNN
BBC
Twitter
YouTube

This might not be illegal, but it is rather disrepectful towards the user. Not only are these websites breaking my trust — when I visit your website, I entered into contact with you, not 12 other websites — but they are loading content from websites neither know nor trust. This is my principal reason for using a content blocker like uBlock Origin. 

My trouble isn't with ads per se. If websites hosted their own ads and displayed them responsibly, I wouldn't care. But when those ads are used to track me, send my information to and load code from third parties, often through insecure channels, I find it to be a basic necessity. Even the New York Times couldn't protect its XX monthly user from malware spread through their pages thanks to an ad network.

If you're reading this and are wondering what to do to protect yourself, skip ahead to the The Way Forward section. 

If you run a website and you put official share buttons on your website, use intrusive analytics platforms (like X and Y), serve ads through a third-party ad network or use pervasive cookies to share and sell data on your users, you're contributing to a user-hostile web. Using free and open-source tools created by thousands of collaborators around the world, on the open web, in the spirit of sharing and advancing humanity. 

## Gated Communities (or the simple beauty of httpd)

One of the most impressive things about the internet (and consequently also the web) is that it is decentralized. No central authority gets to decide which page is more important than others and you don't have to play by anyone else's terms to publish and read what you want. There's isn't anything like a *main server* that stores the code that runs the Internet; it's just a protocol on a physical backbone (of undersea cables). 

You could buy a Raspberry Pi Zero today for 5€, connect it to the internet, set up a chat server on it, give it a public address and the world would be able to connect to it and talk to one other. Sure, it might not perform too well and no one might actually use it, but it's technically possible.

But most of the time we spend on the web today is no longer on the open internet; it's on Facebook. While Facebook provides a valuable service, it is also a for-profit, private company. Their source of revenue is advertising.
 
It is the epitome of centralized. Try posting a picture of the (nude painting) or your naked breasts; you can't. It's against their terms of use. To use their platform, you have to agree to whatever conditions they set, however absurd. If you replace the open web with Facebook, you're giving up your right to publish and share on your terms. 

This works because you'll agree to it. You'll say you don't have a choice, because your friends are all there. And that is Facebook's currency; their actual source of strength. Without the users, it would be nothing. But without Facebook, you'd only be inconvenienced. 

Facebook needs you more than you need it. 

-- You're the currency they use to sell themselves to Google.
-- They actually DO want to trap you and not let you leave. Tie you into their systems. 
-- It's not a dystopian fantasy -- these are actual strategies being discussed in big companies. And they don't have your best interests at heart.
-- Even email is open, but Messenger isn't. 
-- Facebook: page about micro targeting, Cambridge Analytics

You see, the web is actually pretty simple.

A web server, a public address and an HTML file are all that you need to share your thoughts (or indeed, art, sound or software) with anyone in the world. No authority from which to seek approval, no editorial board, no publisher. No content policy, no dependence on a third party startup that might fold in three years.

That's what the web makes possible. It's friendship over hyperlink, knowledge over the network, romance over HTTP.

In fact, the browser you're reading this on (Chrome, Firefox, Links, whatever), the web server that's hosting this website (Nginx), the operating system that this server runs on (Ubuntu), the programming tools used to make it all work (python, gcc, node.js...) -- all of these things were created collectively by contributors all around the world, brought together by HTTP. 

The web is open and democratic by design and it empowers people, whoever or wherever they are. This is the web we're breaking. 

## Free but not Free
The modern web began, I think, when it expanded from an information system to a broader platform for information and services. 

Hotmail wanted to give everyone in the planet a free email address. Search engines like Google (and Dogpile, Excite, Altavista and Northern Lights, for those who remember) offered to help us find relevant information in a rapidly growing, unorganized collection of linked documents. There was even a period where Mozilla's DMOZ projet had the ambitious goal of being an open, human-run directory of all things on the internet (much like the yellow pages of yore). Then came Wikipedia, perhaps the most ambitious project in organizing human knowledge since the library of Alexandria (but more open). 

The next big breakthrough was e-commerce, the ability to buy and sell over the internet. This naturally brought a lot of value to humanity: people could browse and buy stuff from the comfort of their homes and businesses big and small could reach more people. Amazon went from being a relatively small online bookstore to a global marketplace. eBay became a global marketplace for people wanting to buy and sell second-hand goods. Paypal promised to let anyone send and receive money from anyone, anywhere in the world.

Up to this point, the goal is still broadly to serve people. Companies, though, start realizing that maintaining a large website serving thousands of users requires time, energy and resources. It costs money.

## The Way Forward


-- To start with: fewer share buttons, dependencies, etc.
-- HTTPS Everywhere.
-- they go far: fingerprinting etc. Can have real consequences (behavioral design, addictive UX)
-- End user: use UBlock Origin, if only to protect yourself.
-- Companies are openly saying that they'll know more about you than you know (re: quote Eric Schmidt, Microsoft Cortana).
-- Crypto currencies.
-- Ad networks. Serve your own ads! Why are these beneficial?
-- Hyper personalisation? Again, the benefits are debatable but the consequences are dangerous. 
-- Have business models where your client is actually your client. Respect people instead of using them. If you can't honestly share your business model with your client, maybe you need to ask questions.
