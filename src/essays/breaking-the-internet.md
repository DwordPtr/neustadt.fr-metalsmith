We're breaking the web.

That's right, us architects of the modern web — web designers, UX designers, developers, creative directors, social media managers, data scientists, product managers, start-up people, strategists — are breaking one of humanity's greatest inventions without even realizing it.

Most of us probably have no idea what the web is. We know how to talk about *immersive experiences* and *personalized content*, *responsive strategy*, *parallax effect*, *social media strategy*, *good CRM* and *user experience*, but really we have no idea.  

## Bloat and Dependency
	- Average page size
	- Side effect: bad design patterns like "parallax scrolling" or stroll hijacking

## Recentralization (Gatekeepers)
	- How simple is it go online? Very simple. Anyone can do it. It's nice to have services but shouldn't forget that we don't *need it*
	- We let them become the arbitrers of content. And with increasing "personalization" (the weird assumption that somehow if I look something up, that that should establish a pattern and that I'd want more of the same), filter bubble.
## The Death of Anonymity

## The web as a market ("users" = value) instead of playing field, security vulnerabilities


## Design, Art and Fun
## Accessibility (maybe 1)
