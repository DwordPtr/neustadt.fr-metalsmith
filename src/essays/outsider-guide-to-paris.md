This is a guide to surviving Paris as an outsider. Not the Paris in Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris (charming as that was) but the real Paris. My Paris.

I say "outsider" and not expat or foreigner or holiday-maker because those words sound absolutely ridiculous to me. "Expat" makes me think you're a nondescript diplomat (or that you work for an NGO of some sort, not that there's anything wrong with that), "foreigner" is midly condescending (even if you're referring to the band) and "holiday-maker" can only possibly refer to people who get on those hop-on-hop-off buses and contribute to the continued existence of the industry that produces selfie-sticks. If you have a selfie-stick, this guide is probably not for you.

This is a guide for those who want to understand Paris as the living, breathing, diverse, chaotic metropolis that it is. Whether you're visiting for the weekend, on exchange, for an internship, a job, a round-the-world trip on a bicycle -- my hope is to give you a few tips on making the most of your trip.

## About your guide

What exactly are my qualifications for writing this guide, you ask? You didn't really (text is not the best medium for audience interaction), but I'll tell you anyway.

I've been living in Paris for over the past four years. I've seen its good sides and some pretty darn horrible ones. Although, as a designer at an ad agency that gets around on a single-speed bicycle and is proud about his growing second-hand record collection, I'm probably not the person to tell you about the really, really horrible bits. Oh well.

I used to also run a website called studentParis.com with tips for international students in Paris; I've long since abandoned that project but I thought I'd make up for it with this article. So tip 1, Parisians are lazy, just like the lot of you.

## Traffic

You don't need a car in Paris. The metro system works well (most of the time) and the stations are ridiculously close to one another. Within the périphérique—the ring road that separates the Paris you'll be visiting from the Paris you won't—you'll generally be able to walk about 5 to 10 minutes in any direction, even in flip flops, before spotting a metro station.

What surprises me is how bad the traffic is. I've had to deal with trucks parked on the bike lanes and cars turn right without signaling (or signaling once they start turning, that's always nice). Just yesterday a cyclist valiantly defended her unalienable right to not stop for a mom with a young boy *and* a stroller on the crosswalk even if was red for her. People even routinely cross the road on red despite having seen and acknowledged an approaching car or bicycle (but not a truck; they're not stupid), then are surprised and mildly annoyed that said vehicle had to make a big fuss by screeching to a halt for them.

My friends tell me it has something to do with liberté and pride and whatnot. I blame it on bad education and a lack of respect for other residents, but it's not a popular opinion.

If you ask me, the whole thing would be easier if people just followed the rules. Not that I'm defending rules or failing to acknowledge the the unwelcome dominance of cars in modern cities. It's just that the average Parisian seems to want to get nowhere in particular very fast and always be first. Even if it involves failing to see how speeding on orange and finding yourself stuck in the middle of the intersection, blocking traffic in all directions, might not be the best strategy.

I recommend walking. 

## Metro

If you're going to have to take the metro, you'll have to get used to a few things. If it's rush hour, you might get to observe that great Parisian hobby of waiting for people to get off the train whilst standing right in front of the door through which they're supposed to get off. 

I'm sure this is something to do with liberté as well. 

Another Parisian hobby is to run for the train as the doors are closing—you know they're closing because there's a perfectly annoying noise accompanied by flashing red lights—and try to make it in. This sometimes involves forcing the doors back open, delaying the train by a few seconds. That way, you're able to save the 2 minutes you'd have to wait for the next train.

## Eating

Paris is fantastic for eating. Even if you're vegetarian, or mostly vegetarian (as I am). Things have really changed for the better in the past two years and you'll now find 

## Language

Sure, when in France, you want to practice your French. It's a good idea too; people appreciate your trying.
